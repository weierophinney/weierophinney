I am Project Lead for the [Laminas Project](https://getlaminas.org) (formerly
Zend Framework), which includes the subprojects [Laminas API
Tools](https://api-tools.getlaminas.org) (formerly Apigility), and
[Mezzio](https://docs.mezzio.dev) (formerly Expressive). My main role with the
projects is to shepherd in contributions and ensure that developers can
collaborate effectively.

The [PHP Framework Interop Group](https://www.php-fig.org) establishes
specifications for users of the PHP language. I'm proud to be a founding member
and two-time Core Committee member, and collaborator on more than a half-dozen
specifications, including [PSR-7 HTTP Message interfaces](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/),
[PSR-17 HTTP Message Factory interfaces](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/),
and [PSR-15 HTTP Handlers and Middleware interfaces](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/),
which, combined, form the core of modern PHP APIs and web applications.

I work at [Zend by Perforce](https://www.zend.com) as Product Manager and
Principal Engineer, where I focus on providing supported PHP runtimes companies
can depend upon.

In my off hours, I am a serial Basset Hound wrangler, Boston Terrier chew toy,
father, husband, and [aspiring artist](https://instagram.com/phlytangle).

I'm known in PHP circles as "MWOP", and sometimes blog at
[my personal website](https://mwop.net).
